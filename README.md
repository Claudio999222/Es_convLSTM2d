# Convolutional LSTM for Predicting Character Movements in MNIST Sequences

## Overview

This notebook explores the use of Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) cells to predict movements of characters within sequences of MNIST images. The dataset used contains sequences of MNIST images where digits move across the screen.

## Key Tasks and Concepts Covered:

1. **Dataset Exploration**: Understand the structure of the MNIST sequences dataset and visualize sample sequences.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the dataset, including normalization and sequence padding, to prepare it for training.

3. **Convolutional LSTM Architecture**: Design a neural network architecture using ConvLSTM cells to predict the movements of characters in sequences.

4. **Model Training**: Train the model on the preprocessed dataset and monitor training metrics.

5. **Prediction and Visualization**: Use the trained model to make predictions on test sequences and visualize the generated sequences.

6. **Create GIFs**: Generate GIFs from the predicted sequences to visually assess the model's ability to predict character movements.

7. **Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance in predicting character movements and generating plausible sequences.

## Application:

- **Video Prediction**: Convolutional LSTMs are particularly useful for tasks involving sequential data, such as predicting the next frame in a video sequence. In this case, the model is trained to predict the movement of digits in MNIST sequences.

- **Dynamic Pattern Recognition**: The model can capture dynamic patterns in the movement of digits, demonstrating the capability of ConvLSTM cells in handling spatiotemporal relationships.

- **Generative Modeling**: The trained model can generate sequences of digits with predicted movements, showcasing its generative capabilities.

By the end of this notebook, we aim to have a model that effectively predicts the movements of characters in MNIST sequences and generates visually plausible sequences.
